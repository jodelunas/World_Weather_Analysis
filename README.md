# World_Weather_Analysis
  The purpose of this challenge was to import weather information from an API call to Open WEather Map on the cities located near the random longitudes and latitudes. A DataFrame was created to hold this information. I then retrieved hotel data for these cities. Using the weather and hotel information I created a map with pop-up markers that held the information. After choosing four locations for a vacation, I used the directions API in google maps to plot a route between the cities. Finaly, I created a map of these four cities with pop-up markers holding the hotel and weather information.
